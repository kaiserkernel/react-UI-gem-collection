# DripUI - Tailwind Components
DripUI is an amazing collection of free UI components to help you develop projects faster and easier.

The most elegant code for a component you want, is one click away :)

## :computer: Site Overview
You can check out the live site [here](http://dripui.vercel.app/)

To copy the code for a component, all you need to do is click on it. Hope the gif helps :)

To see and/or contribute to this project, please follow the steps below.

### :nut_and_bolt: Installation Steps
1) Fork this repository
2) Clone your fork of the repository
3) In your local dev environment, navigate to the project directory
4) Run `npm install` to install dependencies
5) Run `npm run dev` to start the server on `https://localhost:3000`

### :wrench: Adding a component
- To add say, a new card component to existing card components, navigate to the `/components` folder. 
- Inside the `/components` folder, you'll find the `/drip` folder.
- Existing component folders will be displayed inside `/drip`
- To add a new card, open the `/cards` components folder, and add your new component to the existing code
- Therefore, you would add the new card component code below the already existing ones.

### :wrench: Adding a new type of an already existing component
- As you can see in the `/cards` folder, we can have different types of files representing different types of cards.
- To create a new type of card, say colored  shadow cards, you would need to create a new file in the `/cards` folder called `coloredShadowCard.js` 


#### Note
> There is a naming convention when naming files. It is [component type] + [type]. `coloredShadowCard.js` mentioned above is a good example. `coloredShadow` = [component type] and `Card` = [type].

- Although we would appreciate contributions that help to expand the set of components we already have, we advise opening an issue where we can discuss if the new type of component you want to add is suitable for the collection.

### :wrench: Adding a new collection of components
Say you wanted to add a new collection of components. `Testimonials` for example.

- In the `/drip` folder inside `/components`, create a new folder and give it the name of the new collection. That is `/testimonials`
- Inside the new collection folder, create new files corresponding to the type of testimonial components you want to add. Please refer to the naming convention mentioned [here](#note)

- Before you add a collection, please open an issue to have a brief discussion on how components would be presented.
